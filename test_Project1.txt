Model checking: Rmin=? [ F "done" ]
Switching engine since only sparse engine currently supports this computation...

Warning: Disabling Prob1 since this is needed for adversary generation

Prob0A: 9 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000000, setup 0.00)

Prob1E: 10 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000000, setup 0.00)

Warning: PRISM hasn't checked for zero-reward loops.
Your minimum rewards may be too low...

goal = 4, inf = 0, maybe = 61
